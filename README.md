K-Armed Bandit Algorithm with Epsilon-Greedy Strategy:<br/>

1. The k-armed bandit recommender is designed for recommendation systems where agent needs to choose among multiple items (arms) with unknown reward to recommend products or content to users. The challenge is to maximize rewards by deciding when to explore new options and when to exploit known ones.<br/>
2. An epsilon-greedy strategy is used to occasionally explore random items with probability epsilon, while mostly recommending items with the highest estimated engagement. Over time, this approach learns to recommend items personalized for users.<br/><br/>

Grid Navigation with MDP and Q-Learning: <br/>

This project implements two common reinforcement learning approaches — MDP (Markov Decision Process) Value Iteration and Q-Learning — in a grid environment. The goal is to navigate from a random starting point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles.
